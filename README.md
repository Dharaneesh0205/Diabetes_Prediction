# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing medical and demographic information, the model helps in early detection and prevention by classifying whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- Interactive prediction using a trained model

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project typically includes features such as:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
