# Diabetes Prediction

![Diabetes Prediction Banner](images/diabetes_banner.png)

## Overview

This project aims to predict diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing medical and demographic information, the model helps in early detection and prevention by classifying whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- Interactive prediction using a trained model

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project typically includes features such as:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dharaneesh0205/Diabetes_Prediction.git
    cd Diabetes_Prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python src/model_training.py
    ```

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy and recall using Random Forest and SVM classifiers.
- The model provides reliable predictions for early diabetes detection.
